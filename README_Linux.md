# AIO DOWNLOADER – Linux Package

This folder was generated by an automated conversion aiming to make the Windows project runnable on Linux without changing core logic/code.

## What was added
- Shell equivalents for Windows batch/PowerShell scripts (see `*.sh`).
- Executable permissions on shell scripts.
- ### Python: Use `./run_linux.sh` to create a venv, install requirements, and run the bot.

## Script Mapping

> If any PowerShell scripts were complex, please review the `.sh` stub comments.


## Debian VPS quick start
```bash
chmod +x setup_debian.sh run_linux.sh
./setup_debian.sh
./run_linux.sh
```

## Termux (Android) quick start
```bash
chmod +x setup_termux.sh run_termux.sh
./setup_termux.sh
./run_termux.sh
```

> Put your secrets (e.g., API tokens) as environment variables or in a `.env` file if the project uses python-dotenv.
